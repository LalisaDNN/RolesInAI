## Definitions
### ML Project Manager
- The project manager is the person who oversees the entire AI project lifecycle, from planning and scoping to execution and delivery.
- They are responsible for **defining the project goals, scope, budget, timeline, and quality standards**, as well as **managing the communication, coordination, and collaboration among the team members and stakeholders**.
- The project manager also **monitors the progress, risks, issues, and changes of the project** and ensures that they are addressed in a timely and efficient manner.

### Data Scientist
- The data scientist is the person who applies their expertise in **statistics, mathematics, and machine learning** to **analyze, process, and model the data** that is used for the AI project.
- They are responsible for **finding, collecting, cleaning, and transforming the data**, as well as **exploring, visualizing, and interpreting the data patterns and insights.**
- The data scientist also develops, tests, and evaluates the algorithms and models that are used to train and deploy the AI solution.

### Data Engineer
- The data engineer is the person who **builds and maintains the data infrastructure and pipelines** that are used for the AI project.
- They are responsible for **designing, implementing, and optimizing the data architecture, storage, and integration systems**, as well as ensuring the data quality, security, and scalability.
- The data engineer also supports the data scientist by providing the data access, ingestion, and transformation tools and services.

### ML Engineer
- ML Engineers are professionals who work as middle men between theoreticians who develop the algorithms and implementers who put them into practice in applications. 
- Their strength is in the ability to take a trained model and then transform it into a solution that can be deployed to production.
