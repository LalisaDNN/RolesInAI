# Roles in an AI team
When it comes to building an AI or ML applications, many people think that this job only needs an ML Engineer or a Data Scientist. Data scientists can implement and train an ML model with predictive performance on an offline holdout dataset, given relevant training data for their use case. However, the real challenge isn't building an ML model. As shown in the following diagram, only a small fraction of a real-world ML system is composed of the ML code. The required surrounding elements are vast and complex.
